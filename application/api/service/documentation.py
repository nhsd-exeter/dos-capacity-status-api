    The API will enable UEC service providers and DoS Leads to change the Capacity Status \
    (also known as the RAG Status) of their active services in DoS by means of a collection \
    of restful endpoints that can be called from third party systems. </BR> \
    Upon successful retrieval or update of capacity information, this API will respond \
    with the current (updated) capacity information for the active service. All required fields \
    will be returned, but optional fields will not be returned in the cases where no \
    data is present for them. For example, if there is no reset date/time for an active service \
    (in the case where the active service is in a GREEN capacity state) the reset date/time field \
    will not be included in the response. Refer to the endpoint specifications below for \
    API response details. </BR> \
    All endpoints of this API require that the ID of the service to retrieve/update is given in \
    the URL. If no such active service can be found in DoS for the given ID an HTTP-404 error code \
    will be returned. </BR>\
    </BR> \
    <B>API Authentication</B></BR> \
    </BR> \
    The API is protected by means of an Token authentication mechanism. Clients interested \
    in using the API will need to obtain an Token from NHSD, and this Token will need to be \
    sent through as part of the request in the call to the API endpoints. </BR> \
    As part of the API Token creation process, clients will be required to specify a valid and active DoS \
    user account (username) that the API Token will be associated with. This will be used for \
    the API's authorisation process. </BR> \
    </BR> \
    <B>API Authorisation</B></BR> \
    </BR> \
    The endpoints provided by this API that update service capacity information are additionally \
    protected by an authorisation mechanism which confirms that the DoS user (associated with the \
    API Token) has the correct permissions configured in DoS to be able to update the target service. \
    In the event that a DoS User does not have permissions to update the capacity status of a service, \
    an HTTP-403 error code will be returned and the capacity status information of the service will \
    not be updated."

        of time in minutes as defined by the resetStatusIn value given in the request payload. If this value is not provided, the reset time will default to \
        %d hours from the time the capacity status is updated. A capacity status change to Red or Amber for a service can be set to persist for a maximum period of %d hours \
