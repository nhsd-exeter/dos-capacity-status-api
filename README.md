## Quick Start

### Prepare Development Environment

#### Minimum setup

    brew install make
    export PATH=/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH
    cd capacity-status-api
    make dev-install-essential

#### Full setup

    cd capacity-status-api
    make dev-setup

### Recommendations

* Use iTerm2 and Visual Studio Code for development
* Before starting any work, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Run the Project

### Ops Routine

    cd capacity-status-api
    make project-trust-certificate
    make project-build
    make project-start project-log # Press Ctrl-C to exit
    open https://localhost:8443/apidoc/
    make project-stop

#### Dev Routine

##### Pre-requisites

You'll need to have the following installed:
    Python version 3.7.5
    Pip version 19.3.1

##### Configuring the development environment

To run the application locally, you'll first need to create a python virtual
environment that has all of the relevant python modules and extensions that
the application requires.

First, create a python virtual environment as follows:

sudo pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv $HOME/pythonvirtenvs/capacity-status-env

Activate the virtual environment:

source $HOME/pythonvirtenvs/capacity-status-env/bin/activate

Now install all of the extensions & load the static server files:

First, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

make project-build
make api-build

##### Running the application in the development environment

In the development environment, the application runs in debug mode on port 8000

To run the application, make sure that you have your python virtual environment
activated:

source $HOME/pythonvirtenvs/capacity-status-env/bin/activate

Now run the following to start the application in the root directory of the
project:

make project-start
make api-start

The application is configured to run on http://localhost:8000/apidoc/ in the development environment.

## Unit testing

### Creating unit tests

* Ensure test files are created in a relevant sub-directory under the test directory of the app under test.
* Ensure all test files are prefixed with "test_" and match the name of the module/class that this test file tests.
* Ensure that import unittest is brought into the test file.
* Base your test class on unittest.TestCase.
* Add the new test file to the __init__.py file so that the unit test runner picks the new tests up.

### Running the unit tests

The unit tests can be run by executing the following command in the root directory:
    ./application/manage.py test api

## Todo

* The `api` image weights more than 300MB. Can we drop the build dependencies but still keep `pg_config` binary?
* Fix the packages versions in the `application/requirements.txt` or do `pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt`
